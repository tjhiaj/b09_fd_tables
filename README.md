# b09_fd_tables

## Overview

This program processes file descriptor (FD) data for system processes, and can display or export the data in various formats based on user-specified flags. The program can be customized to display FD information in different formats, such as pre-processing output, system-wide data, vnode info, and more.

The program processes system data by iterating over process directories, extracting file descriptor information, and displaying it based on the selected flags.

## Disclaimers

- **Default Behavior**: If no argument is passed, the program will display the composite table, which is equivalent to using the --composite flag.
- **Threshold Behavior**: When the --threshold flag is used, the program assumes the default action of displaying the composite table along with threshold data.

### First Iteration
In my first attempt, I focused on meeting the core requirement: listing the file descriptors for processes in the /proc directory. I began by navigating through each process directory (found under /proc/[pid]), looking for the fd directory, which contains links to open files. I also implemented a basic function to identify numeric directories (i.e., process IDs) to ensure I was only examining directories that represent actual processes.

My code used opendir and readdir to iterate through directories and check for symbolic links in the fd directories. Then, using readlink, I was able to retrieve the target of each link, which pointed to the file the file descriptor represented. Additionally, I used stat to get the inode of the target file, which was another piece of information I was tasked with displaying.

### Final Result
The final program iterated through the /proc directories, checked each process's fd directory for symbolic links, and output a nicely formatted list of file descriptors. The program also ensured that any errors during directory access or symbolic link reading were properly logged.

Looking back, the first iteration served as a good foundation, but it was the process of identifying and addressing inefficiencies, improving the user experience, and tightening error handling that led to the final, more polished version of the program.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Compile the Program**: Use the included Makefile to compile the program.

   make
3. **Run the Program**: Execute the program with the desired flags. Some example usage:

   ./showFDtables --summary --threshold=100
   
   ./showFDtables --composite
   
   ./showFDtables --systemWide --output_TXT
   
   ./showFDtables 1234
   
   If no arguments are passed, the program will display the composite table by default.

## Comments on Implementation

- **Refactoring**: Various modules were refactored to streamline flag processing, improve maintainability, and prevent function signatures from becoming too large with new flags.
- **Performance**: The program processes directories and file descriptors efficiently, but may be limited by system permissions and the number of processes being monitored.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling has been implemented for file operations such as reading symbolic links and opening directories.
